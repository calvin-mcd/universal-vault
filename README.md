# universal-vault

The universal vault aka "omnivault" aka "v-all-t" is a community, open source pcb for the vault35. It tries to cover as many alpha layouts as possible while maintaining the original bottom row of the vault35. It uses a STM32F072 to reduce the amount of components while still supporting RGB for underglow.

## Layout

The following Alpha Layouts are included and labelled with letters:

- V = Original Vault Layout
- A = Alpha Stagger
- O = Ortho
- K = Katana
- U = Uniform Stagger
- T = Treadstone

1 Oled is supported in two positions. 2 Rotaries are supported in separate positions. There are various options for ISO and other keys.
